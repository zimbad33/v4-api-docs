Overview
========

The purpose of this document is to provide detailed descriptions for RewardOps API v3 â€” calls, parameters and responses. These can be tested using our [interactive API console](https://app.rewardops.net/api_docs/console).


Introduction
============

## Security

### HTTPS

All requests must be performed using SSL via the HTTPS protocol.

### OAuth

RewardOps uses [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/2/) with the Client Credentials grant type. This grant type requires you to use your `client_id` and `client_secret` to create a temporary access token, which is sent with subsequent API requests.

#### Generating an access token

To get an access token, send a POST request to `https://app.rewardops.net/api/v3/auth/token`. The request must have an `Authorization` field in the header. The value of the field must be `Basic $ENCODED_CREDENTIALS`, where `$ENCODED_CREDENTIALS` is your `client_id` and `client_secret`, separated by a colon (`client_id:client_secret`) and base64 encoded.

The JSON response will contain an `access_token` that you can use in subsequent requests. Tokens are valid for two hours. When your token has expired, you'll need to request another token before making further API calls. The API server will respond with an error when you make a request using an expired or otherwise invalid token.

##### Example

```nginx
# Base64-encode the client_id and client_secret, separated by a colon. Then use the base64 string in the Authorization header.

echo -n "CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET" | openssl enc -base64 -A | { read ENCODED_CREDENTIALS; curl https://demo.rewardops.net/api/v3/auth/token --header "Authorization: Basic $ENCODED_CREDENTIALS" --data "grant_type=client_credentials" --verbose; }

# Response:

{"access_token":"ac7523d4011492d83bfa1ecd5f62ec3c3a1962e1fee84fa53305fc7c75d29c8b","token_type":"bearer","expires_in":7200,"created_at":1428705205}
```

#### Using access tokens

Once you've generated an access token, you can use it to make requests to the API. All API requests must have an `Authorization` field in the header. The value of the field must be `Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN`, where `$ACCESS_TOKEN` is the valid access token that you created.

## Versioning

Different versions of the API have different base URLs. The base URL for API v3 is `https://app.rewardops.net/api/v3`.

## Request headers

| Headers |   |
|---------|---|
| **Authorization** | Must contain `Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN`, where `$ACCESS_TOKEN` is a valid access token |
| **Accept** | Specify the desired response format [optional [application/json]] |
| **Content-Type** | Specify the format of the data payload [optional [application/json]] |


Parameters
==========

The default format for data passed to and from the API is JSON, with the exception of header and URL parameters. The format of the request and response data can be specified by using the Content-Type and Accept headers, respectively. Currently, only JSON is supported and therefore these headers can be ignored at this time.

Validation is performed on the input parameters for each endpoint, according to the type of the parameter. If validation fails for any of the provided parameters, a 400 error is returned with a detailed error message in the response.

Additionally, each string passed to or from the API must be UTF-8 encoded and dates passed to or from the API must follow the ISO 8601 combined date/time format.

## Data types

| Types |   |
|-------|---|
| **integer** | Only numerals [0-9], and an optional leading "-" character to indicate a negative value. |
| **decimal** | Only numerals [0-9], an optional decimal ("."), and an optional leading "-" character to indicate a negative value. |
| **string** | Any characters, but "unsafe" character combinations are stripped (HTML tags, SQL statements, etc.). Must be UTF-8 encoded. |
| **date** | A string representing a date is expected, using ISO 8601 combined date and time format (eg. 2013-08-08T18:34Z). |
| **boolean** | A JSON boolean value (`true` or `false`). |


Status Codes
============

The API employs standard HTTP status codes to indicate the general success or failure of the call to the API server. A complete list of the possible status codes is itemized below.

*2xx* - General success  
*4xx* - Error occurred due to the client's request  
*5xx* - Error occurred within the server

| Status codes |   |
|--------------|---|
| **200** | OK |
| **400** | Bad request (Bad data in parameters, etc) |
| **401** | Unauthorized (Attempt to access a resource outside your domain) |
| **403** | Forbidden (Problem with your credentials or access token) |
| **404** | Not found (Resource or service not found) |
| **409** | Conflict (Problem with the resource and/or service request) |
| **500** | Internal server error |

##### Example Response

```json
"status": "error",
  "result": {
    "error": {
	  "code": 400,
	  "reason": "Parameter Error",
	  "detail": "Validation failed for parameter program_id: is not of type integer"
